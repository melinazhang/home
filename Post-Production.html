			<p> Post-production is putting together the pieces of scenes and adding different components to complete the final look. The first step of post-production is to make sure there is an adequate amount of storage for all the clips that have been filmed.

			<p> 
				The editors cut pieces of scenes and put them together, and the way they do this can greatly affect the pacing. Before doing this, they read the script to decide which parts and how they will cut and put together to make the show seem the most compelling and straightforward. Although this seems like an easy job, putting together all the footage can take a whopping month or a few. They also add the music and mix everything together. After editors have done their part, they present it to the directors, who then give it to the show runners, and they finally give it to the producers for review.

			<h2 id = "sounddesigning">Sound Designing</h2>
			<p id = "sounddesigningp"> <span id = "sounddesigningparagraph"> Sound designing includes making original soundtracks and sound editing. Sound editors put together the audio tracks of the show, cutting dialogue, and adding sound effects. The sound effects are often created by a Foley artist, who recreates sounds. They use unique methods and many materials to recreate noises. Sometimes, actors record their voices over a scene if the sound wasn&rsquo;t captured properly during the take of the scene, or for other purposes, like when a character is thinking about something. This is called &quot;Automated Dialogue Replacement&quot;(ADR). As for the music, it is always best to have original soundtracks (OSTs), because it is quite tedious to figure out all the copyright laws with other people&rsquo;s music. Once all the recordings are finished, sound mixers put the tracks together, adjust volumes, and remove unnecessary sounds.

		<div id = "visualeffectsdiv">
			<h2 id = "visualeffects">Visual Effects</h2>
			<p> The visual effects team consists of a visual effects supervisor and a group of artists and engineers. Some shows that include surreal elements or dangerous scenes need CGI, which is created by this team. Scenes with green screens go through visual effects, and colour correctors. Colour correction and grading is also applied to the footage. Colour correction is to adjust the colours to seem as natural as possible, and colour grading is the process of making the colours an unrealistic hue, often to convey emotions of that moment. The last step is to add the credits, subtitles, and the final touches. This completes the making of a TV show! </p>
		</div>
		<div id = "distributiondiv">
			<h2 id = "distribution">Distribution</h2>
			<p> Distribution is allowing the world to view the final product. Advertising is an important part of distribution as audiences only watch specific content due to the numerous works to choose from. A trailer is made to help advertisement, as well as posters and other ads. Interviews and actors themselves promoting their shows also spread awareness. Other than advertisement, other things must be prepared. A music and sound effects track has to be made in order for shows to be dubbed internationally. Furthermore, a script with the timestamps for each dialogue needs to be created as well, again, for dubbing and subbing purposes. Then, the show is released for the world to enjoy! That wraps up the creation of a TV show! </p>
