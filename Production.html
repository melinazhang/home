			<p  class = "explanation"> This is where the principal photography, also known as filming, happens. The filming does not always happen in the order of the scenes because actors, locations, and staff are not always available. Before shooting though, the cast occasionally gets together for table reads, which are when the actors practise saying the script together. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "beforefilming"  class = "firstparagraph">Before Filming</h2>
			<p> All of the production equipment is usually set up in advance just to make everything easier. Actors also do vocal and physical warm-ups to be in a prepared state to act. They prepare their look with the clothes for the scene; their makeup and hair are done by specialists. Sometimes, special makeup may take a few hours! The last step before filming is for the actors to get into the moment, especially if it is an emotional scene. The cast has to reflect on their character&rsquo;s personality and the current situation they are in. Most actors have the skill to gather their emotions relatively quickly, and can cry on cue. Sometimes though, it is hard to maintain this emotion for multiple takes, and menthol tear sticks can be used, which make your eyes teary. </p> 
			
		<h2 id = "locations">Locations</h2>
			<p> The filming doesn&rsquo;t always have to take place at a location that the scene is depicting. It can take place in a studio that is arranged and set up to look like a place, but most scenes are filmed at a different location because it is usually more efficient and convenient. However, shooting in a studio does have advantages, as you are able to control everything, ranging from weather to noise. To save time, other scenes in different locations and actors could be shot at the same time as one scene. A location scout, a person who finds the perfect location, negotiates the pricing and agreements. They solve any problems relating to the locations of shootings. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "photographycrew">Photography Crew</h2>
			<p> The director of photography first chooses the type of cameras, filters, lenses, etc. They plan out how to make the scene look like what the director wants through photography. During the shooting, multiple cameras are used to capture different angles of the scene. Because of this and retakes, a scene worth a few seconds can take more than an hour. Shows that revolve around the genre of fantasy and other unusual topics are even more difficult to film. These shots are divided and planned during pre-production. During the production, the photography director ensures that the lighting is nice and consistent. Other jobs include people who hold up lighting equipment and a gaffer who is basically a lighting technician. </p>
