			Sometimes, dozens of TV show episodes can be made in the same amount of time as making a movie! How is this done? Well, TV shows from around the world all go through very similar processes in the production, whether it is a drama, comedy, or reality show. </p>
			
			<p class = "introductionparagraph" id = "introductionparagraph2">It all begins when an individual or a company decides to make a TV Show and they propose their ideas to different networks. When a network accepts their proposal, the first stage of making the show begins! There are three main categories of making a TV show that can be divided into even smaller parts. They are exactly what they sound like: pre-production, production, and post-production. </p>

		</h1>
		<div class = "explanation">
			<p>Pre-production is the planning and preparation of everything. This is the most essential step and foundational part of making a TV show and also the first step of the whole process. During pre-production, a director is chosen to lead and decide what the TV show will look like.

			<h2 class = "firstparagraph" id = "writingheading">Writing</h2>
			<p> 
				The process of writing is where writers and the show creators plan out the most important parts of the season, which is basically like drawing a storyboard. This includes the plots, climax, resolutions, and all those literary terms for each episode. The writers then plan out more details of each episode which goes through numerous drafts. The scripts are then assigned to directors and directors of photography who plan on their own.

			<h2 id = "theartdepartment">The Art Department</h2>
			<p id = "theartdepartmentparagraph"> <span id = "theartdepartmentp">The art department is responsible for creating the overall look and the specific details. The production designer usually leads everything. There are various things to do in the art department, like designing the clothing styles and costumes, props, and how sets will look. If the show is taking place in a different time period, especially the past, the art department researches the customs people had back then. This includes the clothes they wore to the objects from that timeline. </span>

			<p id = "castingactorsp"> <!--There are two ways actors can be casted. The first one requires auditions from individuals who initiate their desire to be cast for the role. There are usually multiple rounds of auditions in order to determine who gets the final role. Often, an actor&rsquo;s physical appearance is important, especially if the TV show is based on a piece of work. Directors then look at the level of skill and how much the person who is auditioning matches
			</p>
			
			<p id = "castingactorsp2"> the atmosphere of the character. The second method of casting is that the director initiates and directly reaches out and offers a current actor for the role, because of their talent in previous works.

		<div id = "scheduling">
			<h2 id = "schedulingheading">Scheduling</h2>
			
			<p id = "schedulingparagraph"> Once all the basic elements of pre-production are in place, the last step is to make a schedule. This helps keep everything organized and avoids total chaos. Certain actors, staff, and locations might only be available at certain times, which is why a schedule is especially important. Another reason is that shooting needs to be done in a relatively short amount of time to save money. Each scene has its own mini schedule that contains the actors in that scene, the location, and the time it will be filmed. When these factors of all the scenes are organized, the final document is called a &quot;white schedule&quot;.
