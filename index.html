			<h1 id = "introductionheading">Introduction</h1>
			<p class = "introductionparagraph"> 
			Sometimes, dozens of TV show episodes can be made in the same amount of time as making a movie! How is this done? Well, TV shows from around the world all go through very similar processes in the production, whether it is a drama, comedy, or reality show. </p>
			
			<p class = "introductionparagraph">It all begins when an individual or a company decides to make a TV Show and they propose their ideas to different networks. When a network accepts their proposal, the first stage of making the show begins! There are three main categories of making a TV show that can be divided into even smaller parts. They are exactly what they sound like: pre-production, production, and post-production. 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 class = "banner" id = "pre-productionheading">
			<div class = "h1Title">Pre-Production</div>
		</h1>
			<img class = "bordersquares"src = "Images/bordersquares.jpg" alt = "Border Squares"/>
			<p class = "explanation">Pre-production is the planning and preparation of everything. This is the most essential step and foundational part of making a TV show and also the first step of the whole process. During pre-production, a director is chosen to lead and decide what the TV show will look like.</p>
			
		<div id = "writing">
			<h2 class = "firstparagraph">Writing</h2>
			<p> The process of writing is where writers and the show creators plan out the most important parts of the season, which is basically like drawing a storyboard. This includes the plots, climax, resolutions, and all those literary terms for each episode. The writers then plan out more details of each episode which goes through numerous drafts. The scripts are then assigned to directors and directors of photography who plan on their own. </p>
		</div>
		<h2 id = "theartdepartment">The Art Department</h2>
			<p> The art department is responsible for creating the overall look and the specific details. The production designer usually leads everything. There are various things to do in the art department, like designing the clothing styles and costumes, props, how sets will look, and special effects. If the show is taking place in a different time period, especially the past, the art department researches the customs people had back then. This includes the clothes they wore to the objects from that timeline. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "castingactors">Casting Actors</h2>
			<p> There are two ways actors can be casted. The first one requires auditions from individuals who initiate their desire to be cast for the role. There are usually multiple rounds of auditions in order to determine who gets the final role. Often, an actor&rsquo;s physical appearance is important, especially if the TV show is based on a piece of work. Directors then look at the level of skill and how much the person who is auditioning matches the atmosphere of the character. The second method of casting is that the director initiates and directly reaches out and offers a current actor for the role, because of their talent in previous works. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "scheduling">Scheduling</h2>
			<p> Once all the basic elements of pre-production are in place, the last step is to make a schedule. This helps keep everything organized and avoids total chaos. Certain actors, staff, and locations might only be available at certain times, which is why a schedule is especially important. Another reason is that shooting needs to be done in a relatively short amount of time to save money. Each scene has its own mini schedule that contains the actors in that scene, the location, and the time it will be filmed. When these factors of all the scenes are organized, the final document is called a &quot;white schedule&quot;. </p>
			
		<h1 class = "banner" id = "production">
			<div class = "h1Title"> Production </div>
		</h1>
			<img class = "bordersquares"src = "Images/bordersquares.jpg" alt = "Border Squares"/>
			<p  class = "explanation"> This is where the principal photography, also known as filming, happens. The filming does not always happen in the order of the scenes because actors, locations, and staff are not always available. Before shooting though, the cast occasionally gets together for table reads, which are when the actors practise saying the script together. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "beforefilming"  class = "firstparagraph">Before Filming</h2>
			<p> All of the production equipment is usually set up in advance just to make everything easier. Actors also do vocal and physical warm-ups to be in a prepared state to act. They prepare their look with the clothes for the scene; their makeup and hair are done by specialists. Sometimes, special makeup may take a few hours! The last step before filming is for the actors to get into the moment, especially if it is an emotional scene. The cast has to reflect on their character&rsquo;s personality and the current situation they are in. Most actors have the skill to gather their emotions relatively quickly, and can cry on cue. Sometimes though, it is hard to maintain this emotion for multiple takes, and menthol tear sticks can be used, which make your eyes teary. </p> 
			
		<h2 id = "locations">Locations</h2>
			<p> The filming doesn&rsquo;t always have to take place at a location that the scene is depicting. It can take place in a studio that is arranged and set up to look like a place, but most scenes are filmed at a different location because it is usually more efficient and convenient. However, shooting in a studio does have advantages, as you are able to control everything, ranging from weather to noise. To save time, other scenes in different locations and actors could be shot at the same time as one scene. A location scout, a person who finds the perfect location, negotiates the pricing and agreements. They solve any problems relating to the locations of shootings. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "photographycrew">Photography Crew</h2>
			<p> The director of photography first chooses the type of cameras, filters, lenses, etc. They plan out how to make the scene look like what the director wants through photography. During the shooting, multiple cameras are used to capture different angles of the scene. Because of this and retakes, a scene worth a few seconds can take more than an hour. Shows that revolve around the genre of fantasy and other unusual topics are even more difficult to film. These shots are divided and planned during pre-production. During the production, the photography director ensures that the lighting is nice and consistent. Other jobs include people who hold up lighting equipment and a gaffer who is basically a lighting technician. </p>
		
		<h1 class = "banner" id = "post-production">
			<div class = "h1Title"> Post-Production </div>
		</h1>
			<img class = "bordersquares"src = "Images/bordersquares.jpg" alt = "Border Squares"/>
			<p class = "explanation"> Post-production is putting together the pieces of scenes and adding different components to complete the final look. The first step of post-production is to make sure there is an adequate amount of storage for all the clips that have been filmed. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "editing" class = "firstparagraph">Editing</h2>
			<p> The editors cut pieces of scenes and put them together, and the way they do this can greatly affect the pacing. Before doing this, they read the script to decide which parts and how they will cut and put together to make the show seem the most compelling and straightforward. Although this seems like an easy job, putting together all the footage can take a whopping month or a few. They also add the music and mix everything together. After editors have done their part, they present it to the directors, who then give it to the show runners, and they finally give it to the producers for review. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "sounddesigning">Sound Designing</h2>
			<p> Sound designing includes making original soundtracks and sound editing. Sound editors put together the audio tracks of the show, cutting dialogue, and adding sound effects. The sound effects are often created by a Foley artist, who recreates sounds. They use unique methods and many materials to recreate noises. Sometimes, actors record their voices over a scene if the sound wasn&rsquo;t captured properly during the take of the scene, or for other purposes, like when a character is thinking about something. This is called &quot;Automated Dialogue Replacement&quot;(ADR). As for the music, it is always best to have original soundtracks (OSTs), because it is quite tedious to figure out all the copyright laws with other people&rsquo;s music. Once all the recordings are finished, sound mixers put the tracks together, adjust volumes, and remove unnecessary sounds. </p>
			
		<h2 id = "visualeffects">Visual Effects</h2>
			<p> The visual effects team consists of a visual effects supervisor and a group of artists and engineers. Some shows that include surreal elements or dangerous scenes need CGI, which is created by this team. Scenes with green screens go through visual effects, and colour correctors. Colour correction and grading is also applied to the footage. Colour correction is to adjust the colours to seem as natural as possible, and colour grading is the process of making the colours an unrealistic hue, often to convey emotions of that moment. The last step is to add the credits, subtitles, and the final touches. This completes the making of a TV show! </p>
			
		<h2 id = "distribution">Distribution</h2>
			<p> Distribution is allowing the world to view the final product. Advertising is an important part of distribution as audiences only watch specific content due to the numerous works to choose from. A trailer is made to help advertisement, as well as posters and other ads. Interviews and actors themselves promoting their shows also spread awareness. Other than advertisement, other things must be prepared. A music and sound effects track has to be made in order for shows to be dubbed internationally. Furthermore, a script with the timestamps for each dialogue needs to be created as well, again, for dubbing and subbing purposes. Then, the show is released for the world to enjoy! That wraps up the creation of a TV show! </p>
